\begin{abstract}
  We provide evidence both for and against a conjectural analogy between geometrically finite infinite covolume Fuchsian groups and the mapping class group of compact non-orientable surfaces.
  In the positive direction, we show the complement of the limit set is open and dense.
  Moreover, we show that the limit set of the mapping class group contains the set of uniquely ergodic foliations and is contained in the set of all projective measured foliations not containing any one-sided leaves, establishing large parts of a conjecture of Gendulphe.
  In the negative direction, we show that a conjectured convex core is not even quasi-convex, in contrast with the geometrically finite setting.
