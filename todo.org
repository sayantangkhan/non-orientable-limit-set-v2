* TODO Alternative introduction structure
** Analogy to geometrically finite
*** Good parts
Small limit set, i.e. the upper bound only
*** Bad bit
- Not quasi-convex
- Wandering set is empty
** Description of limit set
We care about the limit set because the Hausdorff dimension is conjecturally the growth
exponent.
Describe the limit set.

* Get rid of complex submanifold stuff

* Rephrase and make more precise Theorem 6.2
Look into limits of Strebel differentials.

* Figures
Changes all color references to color and dotted references.
* Misc.
Set up Github to compile and publish.
