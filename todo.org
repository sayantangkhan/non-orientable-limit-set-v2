* TODO Figures
Changes all color references to color and dotted references.
* DONE Alternative introduction structure
** Analogy to geometrically finite
*** Good parts
Small limit set, i.e. the upper bound only
*** Bad bit
- Not quasi-convex
- Wandering set is empty
** Description of limit set
We care about the limit set because the Hausdorff dimension is conjecturally the growth
exponent.
Describe the limit set.

** DONE Get rid of complex submanifold stuff
* DONE Change domain of discontinuity to wandering set
* DONE Rephrase and make more precise Theorem 6.2
Look into limits of Strebel differentials.  The better statement might be trickier because we
would need to lower bound the hyperbolic length of all one-sided curves.
