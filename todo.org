* Referee comments
** TODO Clarify Section 4
*** TODO Add pictures for proof of the claim
*** DONE Add claims showing the $p_3$ is well defined
*** DONE Clarify the whole argument so that it's clearer
** DONE Clarify EGPS result
Perhaps add reference to Ethan's result about interval maps.
Can't seem to find the actual paper.
** DONE Clarify link to counting problem
** DONE Why no counterexamples for lower genera
** DONE Find a bridge between the two different results in the paper
The bridge was that the weaker result followed from the limit set result.
** DONE More intuitive explanation for the hyperbolic geometry argument
** DONE Include corresponding results about $\mathrm{MCG}(S_g)$ in chapter 2 as comparison
** DONE Fix citations for Autumn Kent
* Before submitting to arXiv
** DONE Clarify $k$ and $k'$ in Lemma 3.9
** DONE Clarify continuity of $T$
** DONE Rephrase and make more precise Theorem 6.2
Look into limits of Strebel differentials.
The better statement might be trickier because we would need to lower bound the hyperbolic length of all one-sided curves.
UPDATE: Doesn't work. Replaced statement with weaker version.
UPDATE: Alex suggested a modification.

** DONE Figures
Changes all color references to color and dotted references.
** DONE Clean up Section 4
Especially remove the $\tau$ bit, and think about whether reduction to case 2 is really
necessary.
** DONE Figure out where the $g \geq 3$ is used.
** DONE Change topological foliation to zero intersection number
** DONE Other corrections in pdf Alex sent
** DONE Make convex combinations lemma more precise by working in MF only
** DONE Lemma 3.5: Don't name constants and omit proof
** DONE Alternative introduction structure
*** Analogy to geometrically finite
**** Good parts
Small limit set, i.e. the upper bound only
**** Bad bit
- Not quasi-convex
- Wandering set is empty
**** Description of limit set
We care about the limit set because the Hausdorff dimension is conjecturally the growth
exponent.
Describe the limit set.

*** DONE Get rid of complex submanifold stuff
** DONE Change domain of discontinuity to wandering set
