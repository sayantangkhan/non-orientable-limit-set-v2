#+AUTHOR: Sayantan Khan

* DONE Clarify $k$ and $k'$ in Lemma 3.9
* DONE Clarify continuity of $T$
* Rephrase and make more precise Theorem 6.2
Look into limits of Strebel differentials.
The better statement might be trickier because we would need to lower bound the hyperbolic length of all one-sided curves.
UPDATE: Doesn't work. Replaced statement with weaker version.
UPDATE: Alex suggested a modification.

* TODO Figures
Changes all color references to color and dotted references.
* DONE Clean up Section 4
Especially remove the $\tau$ bit, and think about whether reduction to case 2 is really
necessary.
* DONE Figure out where the $g \geq 3$ is used.
* DONE Change topological foliation to zero intersection number
* DONE Other corrections in pdf Alex sent
* DONE Make convex combinations lemma more precise by working in MF only
* DONE Lemma 3.5: Don't name constants and omit proof
* DONE Alternative introduction structure
** Analogy to geometrically finite
*** Good parts
Small limit set, i.e. the upper bound only
*** Bad bit
- Not quasi-convex
- Wandering set is empty
** Description of limit set
We care about the limit set because the Hausdorff dimension is conjecturally the growth
exponent.
Describe the limit set.

** DONE Get rid of complex submanifold stuff
* DONE Change domain of discontinuity to wandering set
